## Problem Statement: 🤖🍽 AI-Powered Nutrition and Meal Planning Assistant

## 🔍 What We Understood from the Problem Statement:
The goal is to create a smart assistant that helps users manage their nutrition and meal planning using AI. This assistant should be able to understand user preferences, dietary restrictions, health goals (like weight loss or muscle gain), and daily routines to suggest personalized meal plans. It should also offer real-time guidance, grocery lists, and nutritional breakdowns to make healthy eating simple, efficient, and sustainable.

## 🛠 Our Approach / How We Plan to Solve It:
1. **User Profiling**: Collect data on user preferences, dietary goals, allergies, and lifestyle via a simple onboarding form.
2. **AI-Powered Meal Recommendation**: Use API to generate personalized meal plans based on the user profile.
3. **Nutrition Analysis**: Integrate with a nutrition API to fetch calorie and macro details of each meal suggestion.
4. **Smart Grocery List Generator**: Automatically generate grocery lists from the weekly meal plan.
5. **Interactive Dashboard**: Build a user-friendly interface showing daily meals, nutritional stats, and recommendations.
6. **Progress Tracking**: Let users log what they ate and track progress toward their health goals over time.

## 🧰 Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript — for fast, SEO-friendly, and scalable UI development.
- **Backend**: Firebase — for authentication and backend logic.
- **Database**: Firestore (Firebase) — for storing user profiles, meal plans, and nutrition data.
- **Version Control**: GitHub — for collaboration and code versioning.
